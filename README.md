# Groupie Tracker

## 📝 Description
Groupie Tracker is a web application written in Go that fetches and displays data from an external API about music artists. The website presents detailed information for each artist, including images, band members, concert locations, and album history.

The app interacts with a structured API to provide a complete and user-friendly experience by showing:

- Artist name and picture  
- Year the artist started  
- Date of their first album  
- Band members  
- Locations of past and future concerts  

It parses and organizes this data, then dynamically displays it on a styled web page using HTML and CSS.
